      <p>Our Earth is in crisis. All the environmental issues we face today will be exemplified and put onto the shoulders of our children and our children’s children if we don’t make a change and do better. It is our responsibility to ensure future generations don’t have to bear the burden our current actions are putting on them. These environmental issues are global, meaning they affect everyone regardless of our race, class, gender, or differences. We should be connected in our collective goal of bettering our Earth. Through caring for our environment, we ensure that the minerals and resources we have will be sustained. Resources such as clean air, water, and food are important in our society and essential to survival. If we continue to harm our Earth, these resources won’t be around for future generations to benefit from. Without a clean environment, we endanger all the animals and species that inhabit this earth. Animals are going extinct, and ecosystems are facing collapse. If we continue to not prioritize the health of the environment, we are putting many species at risk. </p>

      <h3>What are some solutions to this environmental issue?</h3>
      <h4>Some  short-term solutions could be…</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Turn off the lights when you leave a room to conserve energy</li>
        <li>Conserve water by taking shorter showers and using less water in general</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Some long-term solutions could be…</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Consuming fewer goods. Living minimally ensures there are fewer products that need to be extracted, produced, and shipped around the world</li>
        <li>Stop cutting down trees, or replace every tree cut with two new ones. Deforestation is a huge problem, and stopping the cutting down of trees is the best way to mitigate that problem. We can find better, more environmentally friendly alternatives</li>
